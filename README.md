# 1972-Chevrolet-Nova

I am creating this to track all of the modifications that have been made to my 1972 Chevrolet Nova. 

- The stock V6 engine was replaced with a 496 stroker which is managed by a Fitech Meanstreet EFI system.
- The transmission was replaced with a rebuilt 4L80 (3-speed with overdrive).
